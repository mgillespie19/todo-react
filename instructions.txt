UI Requirements

Input area for adding new ToDos
may also need "add" button
List of ToDos
Each ToDo has:
checkbox (or another way of checking off) to complete
name of ToDo
button to delete
Style Requirements

App should be nicely styled, no elements should look like default HTML elements!
App should be centered on the page, and liquid layout so it works well on mobile
Media queries not required but may be useful
New ToDo box should not look like a default input
ToDos should be separated from each other somehow
ToDo controls (check off, delete) should be nicely styled
Functionality Requirements

Adding a new ToDo can be done by pressing enter or clicking a button
After adding a ToDo, the input area for new ToDos should become blank
New ToDos added to list
Checking off a ToDo should cause it to stay on the list but be styled differently (maybe strikethrough, or faded, etc)
Deleting a ToDo should remove it from the list entirely
Data Requirements

When page loads, existing ToDos are loaded from the server
When new ToDo is added, send it to the server
When a ToDo is "checked off" or deleted, send that to the server
